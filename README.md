# hello-world
This is my first repository on Github. I am taking data science courses on Coursera.

I am interested in learning to analyze and present data in useful and compelling ways. Through hands-on experience at my job, I have learned a lot about Salesforce administration, particularly creating and utilizing reports and dashboards. While these tools have taught me a lot, they have also exposed the many limitations of the Salesforce system for filtering and analyzing data. I would like to learn to do more.
